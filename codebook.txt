results.txt is a processed dataset created from a raw data set of  accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial  signals  to be found at 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . 



There are 30 subjects that contributed to the raw data set where each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial device.
